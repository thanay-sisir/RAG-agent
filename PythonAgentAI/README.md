# PythonAgentAI
# Key Features of the Proposed System: <br>
1. 	Automated Document Retrieval: Automatically processes and retrieves relevant sections from academic PDFs based on user queries. <br>
 2. 	Scalability: Efficiently handles large document datasets, making it suitable for academic researchers working with extensive papers. <br>

# Data Handling: <br>
 ● PDF Upload: Users upload research papers in PDF format. <br>
&nbsp;●&nbsp;Text Chunking: The document is split into smaller, meaningful chunks to preserve important sections such as abstracts, methods, and conclusions. <br>
&nbsp;●&nbsp;Embedding Creation: Each chunk is converted into embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the content. <br>
